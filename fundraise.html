      <h3>Help Us</h3>
      <br/><br/><br/>
      <p>As up to date on July 19, 2017, we can't afford to keep our servers running due to lack of donation support
      and due to immense currency exchange. While the servers may look cheap, but due to currency exchange it costs us a lot
      more to run it. Therefore, we greatly rely on donation from our users to keep going.</p>
      <p>Our data are securely backed up, and we can ensure you that all of our services are set into <b>stasis mode</b>
      so when we could run our services again, they can be redeployed easily to <i>last updated configuration</i>. As soon
      as we have enough funds, our services will return functioning as before! Even a donation of $1 will put us one 
      step closer to the goal of this fundraiser.</p>
       <p>We use <font color="red"><b>Paypal</b></font> as our fundraiser service, and you can donate using either credit/debit card,
      or using your own Paypal account</p>
